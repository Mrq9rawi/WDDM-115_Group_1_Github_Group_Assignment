					<h3>Assignment Content</h3>
					<p>
						This group assignment is to gain experience and work with other
						parties; I have already set up groups.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will have to do a project that all the parties agree on. After
						that, you will have to manage 1 person to be the GitHub responsible
						that the repo will be on his user (donâ€™t worry if you want the repo
						to be also in your user fork it).
					</p>
					<p>
						the assessment should be consistent with 50 commits and at least 10
						merges, the project itself should be legitimate, a website that you
						are creating or any project that involves code that you see fit as
						well you will need to make the main branch protected and create a
						develop branch, that is the only one branch that can be merged into
						main, all the feature branches should be merge into the develop
						branch.
					</p>
					<p>you will have two weeks to complete the assignment.</p>
